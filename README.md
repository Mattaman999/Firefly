# Firefly Safety Application

## About The Project

Firefly is an award-winning safety application recognized in the Congressional App Challenge. This sophisticated application leverages modern sensor technology and real-time data processing to provide a comprehensive fire detection and alert system.

### Built With

- **Arduino Uno & Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266)**: Forms the core of the hardware, responsible for collecting sensor data and communicating with the cloud.
- **MQ-5 Gas Sensor**: Monitors gas concentrations in parts per million (PPM), providing critical data for detecting potential gas leaks and fire hazards.
- **Infrared Flame Sensor**: Detects the presence of flames based on infrared light, offering an additional layer of safety by identifying fires that may not be immediately visible or producing smoke.
- **Google Firebase**: A realtime database that updates with low latency, ensuring data is processed and available to users without delay.
- **Flutter**: Creates the mobile application ecosystem, enabling background alerts, live gas PPM tracking, and live flame detection.

Firefly's technology stack ensures a robust and responsive system, crucial for early fire detection and rapid response in emergency situations.

## Key Components

### Sensor Technology

- **MQ-5 Gas Sensor**: Detects combustible gas concentrations, providing early warnings and precise measurements of gas levels in the air.
- **Infrared Flame Sensor**: Offers quick detection of flames by sensing the infrared wavelengths emitted by a fire, allowing for immediate action.

These sensors, in conjunction with the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, form a powerful detection unit that interfaces seamlessly with the Firefly app for optimal safety management.
