# Firefly Safety Application

## About The Project

Firefly is an innovative safety application that garnered recognition as a finalist in the Congressional App Challenge in November 2022. This application is meticulously engineered to enhance the efficiency of fire hazard detection and response.

### Built With

- **Arduino Uno**: Employs cutting-edge sensor technology for accurate fire detection.
- **Google Firebase**: Utilized for robust and scalable data collection and management.
- **Flutter**: Powers the mobile application for intuitive, real-time visualization and alerting.

The architecture of Firefly is designed to significantly improve response times to fire hazards, which is crucial for ensuring prompt alerts and facilitating swift action in emergencies.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run Firefly.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Flutter SDK
- Arduino IDE
- Access to Google Firebase

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Satvikmatta18/Firefly.git
```
2. Prepare the Arduino environment and upload the provided sketch to the Arduino Uno board.
3. Navigate to the `Flutter/firefly` directory and execute:
